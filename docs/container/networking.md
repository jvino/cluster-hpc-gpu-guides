Let's start from the nginx docker container started in the previous section.

The `inspect` command provided details about the networking configuration of the container:

```bash
...
            "Networks": {
                "bridge": {
                    "IPAMConfig": null,
                    "Links": null,
                    "Aliases": null,
                    "NetworkID": "0aa786b7de5fbfcd3e18db78511ed544d450bb0ad198cab0244bc8b83d30b514",
                    "EndpointID": "c3b64e072f7851e3bf55ba3685fa1fbdec6b9c59d18ae27e5e90a1be5728f54c",
                    "Gateway": "172.17.0.1",
                    "IPAddress": "172.17.0.2",
                    "IPPrefixLen": 16,
                    "IPv6Gateway": "",
                    "GlobalIPv6Address": "",
                    "GlobalIPv6PrefixLen": 0,
                    "MacAddress": "02:42:ac:11:00:02",
                    "DriverOpts": null
                }
            }
...
```

To list out the networks in your system, execute the following command:

```bash
docker network ls 
```

```bash
NETWORK ID     NAME      DRIVER    SCOPE
0aa786b7de5f   bridge    bridge    local
19747c3d0c9a   host      host      local
36dc4ef5b900   none      null      local
```

As you can see, our container is attached to the default brige network `0aa786b7de5f` (long ID: 0aa786b7de5fbfcd3e18db78511ed544d450bb0ad198cab0244bc8b83d30b514).
We get more details about this network with the `inspect` command:

```bash
docker network inspect 0aa786b7de5f
```

```bash
[
    {
        "Name": "bridge",
        "Id": "0aa786b7de5fbfcd3e18db78511ed544d450bb0ad198cab0244bc8b83d30b514",
        "Created": "2021-05-27T13:27:32.164161898Z",

                {
                    "Subnet": "172.17.0.0/16",
                    "Gateway": "172.17.0.1"
                }
            ]
        },
        "Internal": false,
        "Attachable": false,
        "Ingress": false,
        "ConfigFrom": {
            "Network": ""
        },
        "ConfigOnly": false,
        "Containers": {
            "2f03f1f2cd100ec584349124a93f180fa743d1c3ab7bcc31c9d8156225d6f06a": {
                "Name": "nginx",
                "EndpointID": "c3b64e072f7851e3bf55ba3685fa1fbdec6b9c59d18ae27e5e90a1be5728f54c",
                "MacAddress": "02:42:ac:11:00:02",
                "IPv4Address": "172.17.0.2/16",
                "IPv6Address": ""
            }
        },
        "Options": {
            "com.docker.network.bridge.default_bridge": "true",
            "com.docker.network.bridge.enable_icc": "true",
            "com.docker.network.bridge.enable_ip_masquerade": "true",
            "com.docker.network.bridge.host_binding_ipv4": "0.0.0.0",
            "com.docker.network.bridge.name": "docker0",
            "com.docker.network.driver.mtu": "1500"
        },
        "Labels": {}
    }
]
```

We can see that the container has an IP address of `172.17.0.2` and uses the gateway address of the `docker0` interface.

Now we know that our nginx service is running on port 80 inside the container. 

Indeed we can contact our service on port `80` using the IP `172.17.0.2`, try the following command from your docker host:

```bash
curl http://172.17.0.2:80
```

```bash

```

All the containers attached to the default bridge network can talk each other.

What if we want to reach the service running in the container using the local network on the host? 

Try the following command:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:80
```
It won't work..you will get: `curl: (7) Failed to connect to 127.0.0.1 port 80: Connection refused`...

We need to publish the service port in the container to a port on our local network. This can be done using the `--publish` option (or `-p`) of the `docker container run` command. The correct syntax is:

```bash
--publish <host port>:<container port>
```  

So let's start another container with this option:

```bash
docker container run -d --name nginx2 -p 80:80 nginx
```

Look at the different description of the two containers:

```bash
docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                               NAMES
8d5609a40033   nginx     "/docker-entrypoint.…"   35 seconds ago   Up 33 seconds   0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp, :::80->80/tcp   nginx2
2f03f1f2cd10   nginx     "/docker-entrypoint.…"   2 hours ago      Up 2 hours      80/tcp                              nginx
```

We can see here that the container port 80 is mapped on the host port 80 (`0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp, :::80->80/tcp`).

As before, the command `docker container inspect` provides further information:

```bash
...
        "NetworkSettings": {
            "Bridge": "",
            "SandboxID": "c66c74726ef8185887d6057d9efd1a4870f0b4b77543213d3bb4fe80db2bd48b",
            "HairpinMode": false,
            "LinkLocalIPv6Address": "",
            "LinkLocalIPv6PrefixLen": 0,
            "Ports": {
                "80/tcp": [
                    {
                        "HostIp": "0.0.0.0",
                        "HostPort": "80"
                    },
                    {
                        "HostIp": "::",
                        "HostPort": "80"
                    }
                ]
            },
...
``` 

Now we can verify that our service is reachable on port 80 of our local network running the following command from the host:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:80
```

Indeed you can reach your service also from outside using the IP of your host. If the inbound connectivity on port 80 is ensured by the firewall rules, you can connect to the nginx service using the browser on your local workstation.

### Using a user-defined bridge network 

In the previous example we have seen that any container you run will be automatically attached to the default bridge network.

!!! tip 
    A user-defined bridge network has some important extra features w.r.t. the default one as described in the official [docs](https://docs.docker.com/network/bridge/#differences-between-user-defined-bridges-and-the-default-bridge) on this topic:
   
    - Automatic DNS resolution between containers
    - Better isolation
    - Containers can be attached and detached from user-defined networks on the fly
    - Each user-defined network creates a configurable bridge

Now use the `docker network create` command to create a user-defined bridge network:

```bash
docker network create mynet
```
You will get the ID of the newly created network, e.g.:

```bash
64319187a52ba82fcbff86b348b42c3ac847e5cfb6a2365b123b7de597ff6eee
```

List the docker networks: you will see also `mynet` in the list:

```bash
docker network ls
NETWORK ID     NAME      DRIVER    SCOPE
0aa786b7de5f   bridge    bridge    local
19747c3d0c9a   host      host      local
64319187a52b   mynet     bridge    local
36dc4ef5b900   none      null      local
```

We can use the `network connect` command to attach a container to a network.
!!! tip
    The syntax for this command is:
    `docker network connect <network identifier> <container identifier>`

Let's connect our first `nginx` container:

```bash
docker network connect mynet nginx
```

Note that the container was already attached to the default bridge network. Let's inspect the container to get the new networking configuration:

```bash
docker inspect nginx
```

```bash
...
"Networks": {
                "bridge": {
                    "IPAMConfig": null,
                    "Links": null,
                    "Aliases": null,
                    "NetworkID": "0aa786b7de5fbfcd3e18db78511ed544d450bb0ad198cab0244bc8b83d30b514",
                    "EndpointID": "c3b64e072f7851e3bf55ba3685fa1fbdec6b9c59d18ae27e5e90a1be5728f54c",
                    "Gateway": "172.17.0.1",
                    "IPAddress": "172.17.0.2",
                    "IPPrefixLen": 16,
                    "IPv6Gateway": "",
                    "GlobalIPv6Address": "",
                    "GlobalIPv6PrefixLen": 0,
                    "MacAddress": "02:42:ac:11:00:02",
                    "DriverOpts": null
                },
                "mynet": {
                    "IPAMConfig": {},
                    "Links": null,
                    "Aliases": [
                        "2f03f1f2cd10"
                    ],
                    "NetworkID": "64319187a52ba82fcbff86b348b42c3ac847e5cfb6a2365b123b7de597ff6eee",
                    "EndpointID": "a232b9e5a82960e12762b949bc83b3e3bd5357580f937b69cae7097384e9eb69",
                    "Gateway": "172.18.0.1",
                    "IPAddress": "172.18.0.2",
                    "IPPrefixLen": 16,
                    "IPv6Gateway": "",
                    "GlobalIPv6Address": "",
                    "GlobalIPv6PrefixLen": 0,
                    "MacAddress": "02:42:ac:12:00:02",
                    "DriverOpts": {}
                }
            }
...
```
As you can see, our container has now two interfaces with IPs 172.17.0.2 (on the default network) and 172.18.0.2 (on `mynet` network).

Note that we can also specify the network when we create the container using the `--network` option. Let's run the following command:

```bash
docker run -it --net mynet ubuntu bash
```

In this way you have created a container that is connected to `mynet` network. 

All containers attached to a user-defined network can communicate using their names (automatic DNS resolution)..so you can contact the container `nginx` directly (you don't need to know its IP).

Run the command `curl http://nginx` inside the ubuntu container to verify that the automatic DNS resolution is working:

```bash
root@2f03f1f2cd10:/# curl http://nginx

!!! tip
    In order for the automatic DNS resolution to work you must assign custom names to the containers. Using the randomly generated name will not work.
