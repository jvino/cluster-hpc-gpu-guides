Portainer is a lightweight management UI which allows you to easily manage your different Docker environments (Docker hosts or Swarm clusters).
Portainer is meant to be as simple to deploy as it is to use. It consists of a single container that can run on any Docker engine.

## Installation

```bash
docker volume create portainer_data
```

```bash
docker run -d -p 9000:9000 --name=portainer --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer-ce
```

## Usage

The UI will be exposed on port `9000` and you will be asked to create the initial administrator setting a password:
